I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/), advised by Professor [Vardan Papyan](https://sites.google.com/view/vardan-papyan/home), and a faculty affiliate researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

My research focuses on developing methods that enable foundation models—particularly in NLP—to learn and operate effectively in complex, real-world settings. Much of my work involves running experiments on large transformer models to study their inner workings, revealing interesting phenomena that both explain model behaviour and inform the design of better learning algorithms. I am especially interested in:
- Mechanistic interpretability
- Reasoning
- Long-context and streaming applications
- Test-time scaling
- Continual learning
- Model merging
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning

Previously, I completed a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Toronto and participated in the [Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/22-23/2022-FUSRP) at the [Fields Institute](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/).

In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, bikepacking, and playing chess. I was born and raised in Toronto, ON, and attended an arts high school, where I majored in Photography.
